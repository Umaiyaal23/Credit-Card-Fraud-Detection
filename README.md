## Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoders in Keras

Please find the dataset used <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKkq5TUTFoQ6TaS3si_-vuj3E_UatxJS/view?usp=sharing"> here </a>.

The aim of this project is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not, by detecting anomalies. It's typically implemented using an algorithm that detects any anomalies in the transaction data and notifies the cardholder and the bank about any suspicious transaction.
